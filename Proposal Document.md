### Summary -
The project we decided was most in reach was a mobile game app for Android users/Google Play. We plan on making a game that is multiplayer to help us better understand working with servers that must transmit player data at a rapid pace. We want to start basic with a simple combat system where each player has 3 combat units, each with varying stats. They will then move them around on a 2D square or hex grid with the goal of defeating the opponent. After we get this process down, it will be about adding as much functionality as possible. This would include features normally present in game store apps like controller support, achievements, randomized loot, and character reskins/models, etc. Android provides multiple helpful APIs to get this working, so the majority of those features should be implementable. We may run into trouble creating a GUI/graphics that are aesthetically pleasing, and intuitive while interacting. The ultimate goal of this app would be to publish a functional multiplayer game with an attainable set of features to the Google Play App Store with minimal bugs.
