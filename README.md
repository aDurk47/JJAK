# JJAK
Capstone Project from team JJAK for the Spring 2020 CMPSC488 class.

Disclaimer: Any art assets were taken from Google Images to enhance the GUI prototype/storyboard, and do not reflect, nor will be used in the final product. They are used purely for a proof of concept.

1.	Files with the extension “.drawio” use the web based diagram creation platform https://www.draw.io/.
2.	Our GUI prototype is also our storyboard, and was created using Adobe XD.
